## SCOPE OF SUPPLY
The scope of supply will include raw material procurement, fabrication, inspection & testing, surface treatment, packaging for shipment & documentation of **SCOPE**

## DEVIATIONS FROM REQUIREMENTS
Welding procedures are qualified to ISO 15614-1, not ASME Section IX.
The recently published ISO 15614-1:2017 states the following:
```
Introduction
...
Two levels of welding procedure tests are given in order to permit application to a wide range of welded fabrication.
They are designated by levels 1 and 2. Level 1 is based on requirements of ASME Section IX and level 2 is based on the previous issues of this document.
...
1 Scope
...
Two levels of welding procedure tests are given in order to permit application to a wide range of welded fabrication.
They are designated by levels 1 and 2. In level 2, the extent of testing is greater and the ranges of qualification are more restrictive than in level 1.
Procedure tests carried out to level 2 automatically qualify for level 1 requirements, but not vice-versa.
```
